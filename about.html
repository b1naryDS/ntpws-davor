                New Musical Express (NME) is a British music, film and culture website and brand.
                Founded as a newspaper in 1952, with the publication being referred to as a 'rock inkie',
                 the NME would become a magazine that ended up as a free publication, 
                 before becoming an online brand which includes its website and radio stations.

                As a 'rock inkie', it was the first British newspaper to include a singles chart, 
                in the edition of 14 November 1952. In the 1970s, it became the best-selling British music newspaper. 
                From 1972 to 1976, it was particularly associated with gonzo journalism
                 then became closely associated with punk rock through the writings of Julie Burchill, Paul Morley, and Tony Parsons. It started as a music newspaper, 
                 and gradually moved toward a magazine format during the 1980s and 1990s, changing from newsprint in 1998.

                The magazine's website NME.com was launched in 1996, 
                and became the world's biggest standalone music site, with over sixteen million users per month.[citation needed] With newsstand sales falling across the UK magazine sector, 
                the magazine's paid circulation in the first half of 2014 was 15,830.
                In 2013, its list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" and the way 
                it was conceived was criticized by the media.
